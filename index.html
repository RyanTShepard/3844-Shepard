                    <p>My name is Ryan Shepard. I have no previous experience in digital writing. I hope that with the help of this course I will have a better understanding of how digital writing works and how to properly use and implement it in my own works.</p>
                    <p2>I'm part of the track team here at Virginia Tech, which takes up a lot of my time. I am an english major, so I end up spending a lot of time reading and writing. In my free time I like to play video games, play sports with my friends, and do stuff outdoors. During the summer, I help out at camps and work with kids. My work in the community is something that I consider the work of a VT shaped student because community outreach and furthering the future of others is a key concept of the VT shaped student and Virginia Tech's motto of "ut prosim".</p2>

                    <ul><li>“These innovators, who may be dreamers today, but who hope to become very active organizers tomorrow, project a unified, if not a centralized, world organ to “pull the mind of the world together”, which will be not so much a rival to the universities, as a supplementary and co-ordinating addition to their educational activities—on a planetary scale.” (Wells, “World Brain”)</li>
                    <li>“Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual” (Bush, “as we may think”)</li>
                    <li>“There is no practical obstacle whatever now to the creation of efficient index to all human knowledge, ideas and achievements, to the creation, that is, of a complete planetary memory for all mankind.” (Wells, “World Brain”)</li>
                    <li>“There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.” (Bush, “as we may think”)</li>
                    <li>“In the hands of competent editors, educational directors and teachers, these condensations and abstracts incorporated in the world educational system, will supply the humanity of the days before us, with a common understanding and the conception of a common purpose and of a common-weal such as now we hardly dare dream of.” (Wells, “World Brain”)</li>
                    <li>“For mature thought there is no mechanical substitute. But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very different things. For the latter there are, and may be, powerful mechanical aids.” (Bush, “as we may think”)</li>
                    <li>"In future decades, virtual faculty, student, mentor, or work relationships will be as rich and effective as current face-to-face interpersonal experiences" (Beyond Boundaries)</li>
                    <li>“The physical and virtual environments of campus, whether in our existing facilities or in new operations around the world, will be designed to support human-to-human interactions, emerging pedagogy, flexible learning, cutting-edge research, and the unique mission of Virginia Tech.” (Beyond Boundaries)</li>
                    <li>“A flexible approach enables students and faculty to be purpose-driven in curricular design and research, thus addressing the complex needs of communities and society at large as they arise.” (Beyond boundaries)</li>
                    <li>“And its creation is a way to world peace that can be followed without any very grave risk of collision with the warring political forces and the vested institutional interests of today.” (Wells, “World Brain”)</li></ul>
                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p3>In unit one it is very interesting to me how easily people predicted the creation of a “world encyclopedia” years before it was possible. The internet has advanced in astronomical proportions since it was invented and it has been an extremely short amount of time. It makes me wonder what kind of changes, that can reshape the world, will happen in the next ten to twenty years or if world peace is achievable through connecting the world like H.G. Wells predicted in “World Brain”. I think that the idea of world peace through the internet might be a long ways off, but I think the idea of connectivity being what brings about peace is not far from the truth. The basis of most conflicts between any two groups of people is a fundamental misunderstanding of the other group. If everyone in the world was connected in some way and were given a common ground then it is feasible that conflicts would become much less common around the world. I think this same concept is what the VT shaped student program is striving for. People going out into the community and doing good work and building relationship in the community can only bring good things. By learning the core concepts of the curriculum through hands on experience and helping people, it will train them to continue to use what they learn to continue to make the world a better place.</p3>
                    <p4>The most challenging thing about writing in HTML for me is the trial and error that goes into it. Along the way making the website, I had to make a change and then submit it to GitHub and hope for the best. Sometimes it would work on my first try and other times, the things that I changed or wrote would not even show up or if they did show up then it would not be in the correct way and I would have to go back and find out what I did wrong. Sometimes my mistakes would be extremely simple and I just left a gap in my writing that I could go back and fix in a few seconds and other times I had no idea what mistake I had made and it was something to do with my formatting, so I would have to rework the section I was working on.</p4>
	                  <p5>When I first started this class, I thought that digital writing only consisted of journalism that was written online. I had no idea that it involved actually creating and designing the sites that all of the writing was on. My idea of website creation was pretty far off the mark compared to everything that actually goes into it. I thought website creators where you just choose what you want it to look like were the only way to create websites. Now I have a lot more respect for people who create complicated websites from the ground up. In my experience HTML is not so much like learning a whole new language, but more like adding a completely new set of grammatical rules to English.</p5>
